# Markdoc Documentation

You should start by looking at the [quickstart](/quickstart) document. That should give you all the information you need to put together a simple Markdoc wiki. You can learn about how to format your documents on the [markup](/markup) page.

See the [configuration](/configuration) documentation for in-depth knowledge about how to write a good `markdoc.yaml` file. The [layout](/layout) documentation will tell you about the basic wiki filesystem layout. After that, the [UnFAQ](/unfaq) page hopefully answers any remaining questions you might have.

The Markdoc projectâ€™s goals and history are described in the [about](/about) page.
