Quickstart
==========

Installation
------------

    #!/bin/bash
    hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/zacharyvoase/markdoc
    cd markdoc/
    pip install -r REQUIREMENTS
    python setup.py develop

Iâ€™ll make an `easy_install`-friendly version as soon as this project assumes some semblance of stability.

Making a Wiki
-------------

Note that, at the moment, this process is unimplemented. This is, however, how I would *like* it to behave:

    #!/bin/bash
    markdoc init my-wiki
    cd my-wiki/
    vim wiki/index.md
    # ... write some documentation ...
    markdoc serve --build
    # .. open http://localhost:8008/ in a browser ...

Requirements
============

The minimum requirements to run the Markdoc utility are:

  * Python 2.4 or later
  * A UNIX (or at least UNIX-like) operating system
  * [pip](http://pip.openplans.org/) (you can get it via `easy_install -U pip`)
  * [rsync](http://www.samba.org/rsync/) -- installed out of the box with most modern OSes, including Mac OS X and Ubuntu. In the future Markdoc may include a pure-Python implementation.

Layout
======

Markdoc wikis have the following layout:

    WIKI_ROOT/
    |-- .html/
    |-- .templates/
    |-- .tmp/
    |-- static/
    |-- wiki/
    `-- config.yaml

The `.html/` and `.tmp/` directories should be excluded from any VCS, since they contain temporary files.

Consult the layout documentation in `doc/wiki/layout.md` for more information on the roles of various subdirectories.
