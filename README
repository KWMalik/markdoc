Quickstart
==========

Installation
------------

    #!/bin/bash
    hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/zacharyvoase/markdoc
    cd markdoc/
    pip install -r REQUIREMENTS
    python setup.py develop

I’ll make an `easy_install`-friendly version as soon as this assumes some semblance of stability.

Making a Wiki
-------------

Note that, at the moment, this process is unimplemented. This is, however, how I would *like* it to behave:

    #!/bin/bash
    markdoc init my-wiki
    cd my-wiki/
    vim wiki/index.md
    # ... write some documentation ...
    markdoc serve --build
    # .. open http://localhost:8008/ in a browser ...

Requirements
============

The minimum requirements to run the Markdoc utility are:

  * Python 2.4 or later
  * A UNIX (or at least UNIX-like) operating system
  * [pip](http://pip.openplans.org/) (you can get it via `easy_install -U pip`)
  * [rsync](http://www.samba.org/rsync/) -- installed out of the box with most modern OSes, including Mac OS X and Ubuntu

Layout
======

Markdoc wikis have the following layout:

    WIKI_ROOT/
    |-- .html/
    |-- .templates/
    |-- .tmp/
    |-- static/
    |-- wiki/
    `-- config.yaml

: `WIKI_ROOT/`
The root of the wiki, containing all of the files required for the `markdoc` utility to build and serve the wiki.

: `WIKI_ROOT/.html/`
Holds the compiled HTML and static files. It is directly served from by the Markdoc webserver.

: `WIKI_ROOT/.templates/`
Contains the Jinja2 templates for documents and directory listings. It comes with some sensible (and pretty) defaults, but you can override these if you wish.

: `WIKI_ROOT/.tmp/`
Used as a temporary build destination directory for rendered Markdown files. This directory is then rsync’d to `WIKI_ROOT/.html/` with `WIKI_ROOT/static`; the incremental nature of this operation means the server can keep running in one process whilst another runs `markdoc build`. This can be helpful in a number of situations.

: `WIKI_ROOT/static/`
Static media files (such as CSS and JavaScript) should be put in this directory. They will be copied to `.html/` by rsync during the build operation.

: `WIKI_ROOT/wiki/`
This contains the actual *text* of your wiki, in `.md` Markdown-formatted files. It is assumed they are UTF-8 encoded. Any files without a valid extension will be ignored.

: `WIKI_ROOT/config.yaml`
This is the main configuration point for your wiki, in a YAML-formatted file. You can find more information in the Markdoc documentation.
