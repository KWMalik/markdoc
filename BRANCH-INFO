The aim of this branch is to rework the `markdoc.config` module to be more
extensible and modular. Some major points:

* This will be achieved by implementing IoC (Inversion of Control) and
  dependency injection patterns. This should enable the creation of extensions
  which are first-class citizens.

* Other code, both in the Markdoc core and extensions, will observe DRY (Don't
  Repeat Yourself) as closely as possible, since configuration defaults will be
  declared in one place only.
